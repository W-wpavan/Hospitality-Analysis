<p>Project Problem</p>
<p>Shodwe Group, a big-sized hospitality chain with properties across india, was struggling with fragmented and delayed reporting.
  </p>
<p>1. Reports were built manually in excel, leading to inconsistant kpi.</p>
<p>2. Management lack visibility into reral-time occupancy and revenue.</p>
<p>3. Weekend vs Weekday booking trends were not tracked making pricing optimization hard. </p>                                                  <p>4. No clear visibility on room category performance or cancellation performance.</p>
